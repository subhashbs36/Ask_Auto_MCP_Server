## Deletion Template

Use this template when processing instructions that remove elements from the JSON document.

### Deletion Types

#### Complete Removal
- **Key Deletion**: Remove entire key-value pairs from objects
- **Array Element Removal**: Delete specific items from arrays
- **Property Elimination**: Remove object properties completely
- **Value Clearing**: Set values to null while preserving keys

#### Conditional Deletion
- **Pattern-Based**: Remove all entries matching a pattern
- **Value-Based**: Delete entries with specific values
- **Path-Based**: Remove entries at certain locations
- **Criteria-Based**: Delete based on multiple conditions

### Processing Steps

1. **Identify Deletion Targets**
   ```
   Target Pattern: {target_pattern}
   Matching Entries: {matching_count}
   Deletion Type: {deletion_type}
   ```

2. **Validate Deletion Safety**
   - Ensure deletion won't break document structure
   - Check for dependencies on the target data
   - Verify that removal is intentional and safe

3. **Execute Removal**
   - Mark entries for deletion (proposed_value: null)
   - Maintain proper JSON structure after removal
   - Handle cascading effects if necessary

### Deletion Strategies

#### Precise Deletion
```
Instruction: "Remove the temporary field"
Target: ["data", "temporary"]
Action: Complete key removal
Confidence: 0.95
```

#### Bulk Deletion
```
Instruction: "Delete all empty string values"
Pattern: value === ""
Action: Remove all matching entries
Confidence: 0.80
```

#### Conditional Deletion
```
Instruction: "Remove outdated entries"
Criteria: Check for date fields or status indicators
Action: Selective removal based on conditions
Confidence: 0.70
```

### Safety Considerations

#### Before Deletion
- **Impact Assessment**: What will be affected by this removal?
- **Dependency Check**: Are other parts of the document dependent on this data?
- **Reversibility**: Can this deletion be undone if needed?
- **Scope Validation**: Is the deletion scope appropriate?

#### Deletion Warnings
⚠️ **Exercise caution when:**
- Deleting large amounts of data
- Removing structural elements
- Deleting data that might be referenced elsewhere
- Processing ambiguous deletion instructions

#### Safe Deletion Practices
- **Specific Targeting**: Be precise about what to delete
- **Gradual Removal**: Consider step-by-step deletion for complex cases
- **Backup Awareness**: Assume user has backups before major deletions
- **Clear Communication**: Explain exactly what will be removed

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Deletion targets are clearly identified
- [ ] Removal is safe and won't break document structure
- [ ] All matching entries are included
- [ ] Confidence reflects certainty about the deletion
- [ ] Reasoning explains why deletion is appropriate
- [ ] No critical data will be lost unintentionally

### Error Handling

#### Common Issues
- **Ambiguous Targets**: Multiple possible deletion candidates
- **Protected Data**: Attempting to delete critical information
- **Structural Impact**: Deletion would break JSON validity
- **Scope Confusion**: Unclear how much to delete

#### Resolution Strategies
- **Clarification Request**: Ask for more specific deletion criteria
- **Partial Deletion**: Remove only the clearly identified targets
- **Alternative Suggestion**: Propose safer deletion approaches
- **Impact Warning**: Explain potential consequences of the deletion
