## Edit Instruction Template

You are processing an edit instruction for a JSON document. Use this template to structure your analysis and response.

### Context
- **Document Type**: {document_type}
- **Total Entries**: {total_entries}
- **Instruction**: "{instruction}"

### Analysis Framework

1. **Parse Instruction**
   - Identify the action type (edit, add, delete, replace, swap)
   - Determine the target location(s)
   - Extract the desired new value(s)
   - Assess the scope of changes

2. **Locate Targets**
   - Find matching map entries based on path or content
   - Consider partial matches and similar entries
   - Validate that target locations exist and are accessible

3. **Plan Changes**
   - Determine the exact modifications needed
   - Consider dependencies between changes
   - Validate that changes maintain JSON structure

4. **Generate Response**
   - Create proposed changes with high confidence for clear matches
   - Include reasoning for each modification
   - Flag any ambiguities or potential issues

### Response Structure

For each proposed change, include:
- **Target Identification**: Which map entry to modify
- **Change Type**: The type of operation being performed
- **Value Transformation**: Current value → New value
- **Confidence Assessment**: How certain you are about this change
- **Impact Analysis**: What effect this change will have

### Quality Checks

Before finalizing your response:
- ✅ All proposed changes directly address the instruction
- ✅ JSON paths are valid and accessible
- ✅ New values are appropriate for their context
- ✅ Changes maintain document structure and integrity
- ✅ Confidence scores accurately reflect certainty level
